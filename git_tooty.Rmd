## Outline
>- I don't `git` `git`, why should I do this?
>- Working with a remote repository --  `GitHub`  
>- Working with a local repository -- `git`
>- Version control *basics* -- review commits, branching, and merging
>- Conclusions and where to go from here

# Motivation

## "I don't `git` it, why should I do this?"
> - Version control -- because you *will* screw something up.
> - Version control -- because uncontrolled version proliferation is *the devil*.
> - Collaboration -- because *everything* is better together.
> - Remote backup -- because your computer *will* die.
> - Public portfolio -- because you *should* demonstrate your 
awesomeness to the world.
>- Encourages reproducibility *and* creativity.

## Things I use `git` and `GitHub` for:
>- My blog -- silas.tittes.github.io
>- All the code I care about (some private on BitBucket)
>- Teaching materials and teaching diary (not private)
>- This presentation

## "I'm not really a coder"
```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/codebro.jpg")
```


## You are, but even if you're "not"
["GitHub is used to manage the collaborative development of recipes, musical scores, books, fonts, legal documents, lessons and tutorials, and data sets"](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2886828/collaboration-software/github-for-the-rest-of-us.html)

```


# Working with a remote repository -- `GitHub` (or `BitBucket`)


## Let's make a `GitHub` log-in and repository!
```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chefcat.jpg")
```


# Working with a local repository -- `git`

## Enter the matrix
```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/matrix.jpg")
```


## Clone your new remote repo
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/octocat/lovecatz.git
```
Now add a bash script and a README.md to your local repository 
on your computer, or create a new file.

## Git used to it -- the basics
You've made some local repo edits to some code, documentation, 
draft manuscript, data, or cookie recipe. What now?
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#See what's changed
git status

#prepare the content for the next commit -- "staging"
git add --all # --all, or specify files

#"The Rub" -- Record changes to the repository
#This is what creates version control
git commit -m "short discription of code changes"

#sync local and remote repos on master branch
git push -u origin master 
```

## Error!
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
git config user.name "Octocat69"
git config user.email "Octocat69@bbqchikn.com"
```

```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stewie.jpg")
```

## Back on track
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#sync local and remote repos
git push -u origin master 

#Up to date?
git status
```
Check out remote GitHub repo to see updates.


## Practice the "add, commit, push" cycle 4X
```{r, out.width = "200px", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/karate.jpg")
```

add, commit, push

add, commit, push

add, commit, push

add, commit, push

# Version control basics

## Version control basics -- reviewing file histories
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#git overview of commits to repo
git log #for whole repo 

#git overview of commits for one file
git log <filename> 

#review int-th previous version of file
git show HEAD~<int>:<filename>
```


## Conclusions
>- `git` and `GitHub` are valuable modern tools even for non-programmers -- learn how to use them!
>- You can now make a solo repo and implement add, commit, push cycles for version control and remote storage.
>- Hopefully you have a sense of the more advanced version control options available to you, even if you aren't comfortable using them yet.

git silly



## Where to go from here
practice lots, read documentation, practice more



# Extra Slides


## Explore previous commits, or testing new ideas -- branch first!
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#create a new branch
git checkout -b branch_name
  
#short term cache of current repo
git stash

#check which branch you're on
git branch #prints asterisk next to current branch

#go back to old commit by hash value
#see git log for hash values
git checkout <commit number>
```



## What now? 
1. If you were just curious, but like the most recent commits:
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#go back to most recent commit
git stash apply
```

##What now?
2. If you screwed up bad and need to go back to previous version.
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#revert to int-th previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~<int> 
#add commit to remote repo
git push origin master
```

## What now? 
3. Or remove branch entirely
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#remove branch name -- caution
git branch -d branch_name
```


## What now? 
4. Push your new branch to remote repo
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
git add --all # --all, or specify files
git commit -m "short discription of code changes"
git push -u origin branch_name
```


## What now? 
5. Merge with master branch, 
```{r, engine="bash", eval = FALSE}
#go back to master branch
git checkout master

#merge branch with master branch
git merge branch_name #read messages carefully!

```


## What now? 
6. Not your repo? Forking and submitting pull requests.
But -- too much too soon.
